## 📹 Tutorial 2: AI Generation Deep Dive (7 minutes)

### Target Audience
Users who want to master AI generation features

### Learning Objectives
- Use different AI models
- Optimize prompts
- Generate images, videos, and audio

### Script

**[0:00 - 0:30] Introduction**
```
Welcome back! In this tutorial, we'll dive deep into KoboNFT's AI 
generation capabilities. You'll learn how to create stunning images, 
videos, and audio using our AI tools.
```

**[0:30 - 2:00] Image Generation**
```
Let's start with image generation. Navigate to the Mint page and 
select AI Generator.

[SHOW: Navigate to AI Generator]

The key to great AI art is writing good prompts. Here are some tips:

1. Be specific about style: "oil painting", "3D render", "watercolor"
2. Include details: colors, lighting, mood
3. Reference artists or art movements
4. Use descriptive adjectives

Let me show you. Instead of "a cat", try:
"A majestic Persian cat with blue eyes, sitting on a velvet cushion, 
oil painting style, dramatic lighting, baroque art"

[SHOW: Type detailed prompt]

See the difference? Much more detailed and artistic.

[SHOW: Generated results comparison]

You can also adjust settings like:
- Image size
- Number of variations
- Style strength

[SHOW: Adjust settings]
```

**[2:00 - 4:00] Video Generation**
```
Now let's create a video! Click on the "Video" tab.

[SHOW: Click Video tab]

Video generation works similarly but with motion. Your prompt should 
describe the action:

"A dragon flying through clouds, camera panning up, cinematic, 
slow motion"

[SHOW: Type video prompt]

Video generation takes longer - usually 1-2 minutes. Let's wait...

[SHOW: Loading animation]

Incredible! The AI created a smooth video based on our prompt.

[SHOW: Play generated video]

You can adjust:
- Duration (2-10 seconds)
- Frame rate
- Motion intensity

[SHOW: Settings]
```

**[4:00 - 5:30] Audio Generation**
```
Finally, let's create audio. Click the "Audio" tab.

[SHOW: Click Audio tab]

For audio, you can:
1. Generate music from text
2. Create sound effects
3. Generate voice narration

Let's create a narration. Type your text:
"Welcome to the dragon's lair, where ancient treasures await"

[SHOW: Type text]

Select a voice style - I'll choose "Epic Narrator"

[SHOW: Select voice]

Click Generate and listen to the result.

[SHOW: Play audio]

Perfect! You can use this as background audio for your NFT.
```

**[5:30 - 6:30] Combining Media Types**
```
Here's a pro tip: combine different media types!

You can:
- Generate an image
- Create a video based on that image
- Add audio narration
- Mint as a multimedia NFT

[SHOW: Workflow demonstration]

This creates more engaging and valuable NFTs.
```

**[6:30 - 7:00] Conclusion**
```
You've now mastered AI generation on KoboNFT! Experiment with different 
prompts, styles, and media types to create unique NFTs. In the next 
tutorial, we'll explore battles and competitions. See you there!
